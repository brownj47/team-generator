## Installation

Install node.js. Then open the index.js file in vscode's integrated terminal and run 'npm i' in the directory where you have the package.json file. 

## Usage

While in the integrated terminal, run 'npm test' to run the test suite. If all the tests pass, then run 'node index.js'. This will start the application. Respond the command line prompts (ids must be numbers). When you have created the cards you wanted, select 'make html' from one of the prompt options, and an index.html file will populate in the /dist folder. Open the file in your browzer to see the output of the application.
